# Afk-bot
An bot to stay AFK on Minecraft servers.
# All features

### Auto skip night
Let the bot auto skip night if it has permissions.
To enable this, go to config.json file and change 
"auto-night-skip" from "false" to "true". If you dont want this anymore you could change it back to "false".
### 24/7 Aternos server
You can also make an Aternos 24/7 server with this.
Just make an template of this Repo, then go to Heroku and make an account if you dont have already. Now create an app on Heroku. Then deploy/connect your repo from Github, then deploy branch. Now start your Aternos server, then go back to Heroku. Now go to Resources and refresh the page. Then enable "worker node index.js".
Now the bot should join the server. It can cost 5-30 seconds. And now go also on the server, now give it creative and put it in an hole underground with torches. Now enjoy your free 24/7 Aternos server!
